# Welcome to Infi.io!

This repo includes all __Proof of Concept__ codes for a bond issuer to publish a new contract and submit it to the blockchain, for a buyer to purchase a particular bond contract and claim coupon payments, par values and for the bond issuer to claim funds out of the contract (all payments settled with a stablecoin of perference). We utilize [Algorand Standardzed Assets](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/features/asa/), [Atomic Transfer](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/features/atomic_transfers/) and [Stateless Smart Contracts](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/features/asc1/stateless/) on the Algorand Platform to deliver those functionalities.

A basic demo rundown script is included at the bottom of the file main_publisher.py. These parameters used in the script is for demonstration purpose only and is not suitable for an actual bond issuance.

Due to limited development time, we were unable to get a full-fledged web application up and running. But we did come up with a prototype [UI/UX design]() independent of our console demo.
